Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, do I make you nervous?
'Cause I make me nervous, too
I hope I don't rub off on you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, do you feel uncertain?
Because I feel uncertain, too
See it from every point of view

Tell me if you're even still with me
Or is it gonna take some convincing?
Standing on the edge and I'm shaking
Will you take the leap?
Counting down the seconds and I'm closing my eyes
I'm bracing for the worst, but I know we'll survive
Tell me that you'll always be with me
I promise not to fuck up completely

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Do I make a good impression?
Sometimes I don't impress myself
Why would I impress someone else?
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Tell me, do I make you anxious?
Because I make me anxious
I hope it's not contagious

Tell me if you're even still with me
Or is it gonna take some convincing?
Standing on the edge and I'm shaking
Will you take the leap?
Counting down the seconds and I'm closing my eyes
I'm bracing for the worst, but I know we'll survive
Tell me that you'll always be with me
I promise not to fuck up completely

I never know, I never really know
I never know, I never really know

Tell me if you're even still with me
Or is it gonna take some convincing?
Standing on the edge and I'm shaking
Will you take the leap?
Counting down the seconds and I'm closing my eyes
I'm bracing for the worst, but I know we'll survive
Tell me that you'll always be with me
I promise not to fuck up completely
Tell me if you're even still with me
Or is it gonna take some convincing?
Standing on the edge and I'm shaking
Will you take the leap?
Counting down the seconds and I'm closing my eyes
I'm bracing for the worst, but I know we'll survive
Tell me that you'll always be with me
I promise not to fuck up completely
Tell me that you'll always be with me
I promise not to fuck up completely
